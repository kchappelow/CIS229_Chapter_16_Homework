# CIS229 Chapter 16 Homework

## Color Chooser

Use a HashMap to create a reusable class for choosing one of the 13 predefined colors in class Color. 
The names of the colors should be used as keys, and the predefined javafx.scene.paint.Color objects should be used as values. 
(Color.BLACK, Color.Blue, etc.)

Use your new class in an JavaFX application that allows the user to select a color using a ComboBox and set a pane's background to that color.

Submit your solution using GIT.
